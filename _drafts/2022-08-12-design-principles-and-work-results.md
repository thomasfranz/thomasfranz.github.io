This post is about presenting and writing about *Sachfragen*. Irrespective of the content that is presented or included. It is not about writing technical topics or even computer science related content.
It should give you guidance and a means to check your written work results, whether it is word-document, a presentation, an Email et cetera.

# Goals of our work results (requirements)
- our readers should be able to easily overview the structure of the document, answering the question *which questions are answered where in the document*
- our readers should easily understand the logical setup of a document, i.e. *how to the different chapters/sections interact with each other or build upon each other*
- it should be easy to infer what content can be expected and what content can not be expected within a chapter or section or paragraph
- it should be easy to follow the argumentation, the overall goal of a document


These goals on documents, presentations and the like map well to goals we have about software. They describe the need for *structure*, or to be more precise *well structure* (because there always may be some structure)
